# Dine Alert
<h3><st> You try the app <a href="https://dinealert.herokuapp.com/">here</a> </st></h3>

The **DineAlert** application is designed to help restaurant owners track their visitors and respond to detection of in-store COVID-19 cases. This would help contain the spread of the virus.

This project includes several individual features. An interface that allows customers to sign up, and report their COVID-19 test results. Furthemore, the interface would allow a restaurant owner to login into the system and check information of customers.

The following describes a sample run of the application. A restaurant customer will insert their name and email into a form, and if they tested positive for COVID-19, he or she must report their test results to the restaurant owner. As a restaurant owner, I can login into the admin system and view the customerâ€™s information. Furthermore, the owner is responsible for informing the potential virus carriers and should suggest them to do swab tests and quarantine accordingly.
